## Problem Statement 
Our world turned upside down with the outbreak. With the ever-growing numbers, essential services have come to a stop, the everyday routine is constricted to with people being forced to go into lockdown. In such a scenario, panic is profound and ubiquitous. Procuring daily supplies is becoming increasingly nightmarish and homebound patients who need assistance are helpless. Though people have been asking help through varied platforms and some have also offered help, there is an absence of a universal stop which serves all needs.

## Our Solution: HumanChain 

HumanChain is an interface that bridges the gap and brings together these people as it suggests, build a human chain for providing help for those in need, to fight this pandemic.

## Features

### User Profile
Once a user registers (or logs in), the profile page shows all his personal details along with the details of all the requests made by him or her & the also all the requests for which he or she has offered to volunteer.

### Need Assistance?
Enter personal details along with some details of the requirement. Assistance is offered under three categories, 
1. Medicines [After uploading prescription to IPFS]
2. Physical Assistance
3. Daily Essentials [groceries, milk, etc.]

While requesting for medicines or daily essentials, the person would have to pay the price of the products to the volunteer in cash.

### Volunteer
One can enlist to volunteer for those in need. The page showcases details of people who need help and the type of help required.

For medicines, volunteers could view the prescription uploaded to IPFS for authenticity of the request.

Once a volunteer is matched to a request, the creator of the request is automatically __notified via email__ about the details of the volunteer so that further communication between them can take place.

### Donate
The platform allows individuals to offer donations both __in cash and kind__ to combat the pandemic.

Financial donations could be made for the causes listed. We have provided and interface for donations via cryptocurrency (ETH) as well as by Card [A test payment gateway has been included].

The feature of donation in kind allows one can upload supplies the person can donate for those in need. Includes groceries, sanitation products, etc.

### News 
This page shows COVID related news from all over the world along with a live counter of the number of people affected by it in a country-wise tally.

## Workflow

## Challenges we faced

1. Issues with versions of `web3.js`
2. Integration of the frontend with firebase & ethereum
3. Finding the suitable framework amongst new frameworks like DappHero, Glitch & Webflow (we tried that initially, but later stuck to vanilla HTML, CSS & JS)
